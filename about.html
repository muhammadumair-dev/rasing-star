            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>Rising Stars of Baltimore is a non-profit organization founded by Brandon. It was founded in 2023 and is based in Baltimore. Rising Stars of Baltimore aims to make Baltimore a better city by connecting the community's youth through various events related to basketball. The events organized by Rising Stars of Baltimore include a basketball tournament and the campaign at Gilman. Currently, Rising Stars is working together with the city to provide lighting for basketball courts at night. For more information, please see the section titled "Our Mission" below.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>The goal of our organization is to help lower the crime rate in Baltimore through positive community participation in youth sports activities. Crime has impacted residents across the city of Baltimore. Teens and other young residents of Baltimore in particular have been heavily affected by crime and a setting which reinforces criminal activity in parts of the city ravaged by poverty. Because of the dangerous environment they face everyday, many young residents do not have the option to initiate or take part in activities which foster a caring community.</p>

            <p>Rising Stars of Baltimore works to create new possibilities and cultivate a supportive and safe environment for young residents. For example, one of our projects will install LED lights into the many basketball hoops located in public courts around Baltimore. In doing this, we aim to reduce crime rates by giving the city's youth something positive to do during the evening hours when crime is most rampant. Additionally, Rising Stars of Baltimore is working with local schools to install these LED lights in their hoops. As a result, schools will be able to provide a safe environment for their students after normal school hours, building a stronger sense of community and encouraging kids to stay in school.</p>
